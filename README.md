# dotfiles
here's my ricing, scripts, configurations and other stuff!


### What's in it?
- nvim configs
- docker daemon
- desktop environment configs/plugins/themes


### KDE/Plasma?
I used to be KDE/Plasma fan but due to some bad expriences on some hardware I've switched to Gnome

If you're looking for Plasma configurations see [Plasma branch](https://github.com/ainyava/dotfiles/tree/plasma).
